I come from an engineering background, I studied mechanical engineering at EPFL in Switzerland.
After working as an engineer for a while I realized that I wanted to become an entrepreneur and that most of my ideas were web-based. 
`Hence I decided to learn how to code!`

And I'm glad I did! Coding is cool!

I'm now a freelancer and co-founder of <a src="https://eligia.fr">Eligia</a>

See you around! 🔥🚀
