I come from an engineering background, I studied mechanical engineering at EPFL in Switzerland.
After working as an engineer for a while I realized that I wanted to become an entrepreneur and that most of my ideas were web-based. 
`Hence I decided to learn how to code!`

And I'm glad I did! Coding is cool!

I'm still pretty pretty green but I'm doing my best to learn as much as possible!
